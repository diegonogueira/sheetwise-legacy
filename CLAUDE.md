# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

Sheetwise is a web-first (React + Vite) app for practicing **staff reading** — naming notes,
placing them on the staff, and identifying key signatures, in the treble, bass and C clefs.
See `README.md` for the product overview. This file covers the non-obvious architecture and
conventions. It is a sibling of **fretwise** (guitar-neck trainer) and shares its chassis:
URL routing, zustand settings store, Tailwind v4 `@theme` tokens, pure tested `src/core`.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # dev server at http://localhost:5173
npm run build        # tsc --noEmit && vite build  (type-check is part of build)
npm test             # vitest run (core musical logic only)
npm run test:watch   # vitest watch

npx vitest run src/core/clef.test.ts    # single test file
npx vitest run -t "linha inferior"       # single test by name

npm run android:apk      # build + cap sync + gradle assembleDebug
npm run android:install  # adb install -r … app-debug.apk
./scripts/gen-icons.sh   # launcher icons from src/assets/brand/*.svg
```

`npm run build` fails on unused locals/parameters (strict TS with
`noUnusedLocals`/`noUnusedParameters`). Type errors are caught at build time, not by a
separate lint step — there is no ESLint config.

## Architecture

**`src/core/` is the single source of truth and is pure (no React).** The staff renderer,
the exercise engine and the audio all derive note identity from it. New training tools
should be built as new tasks on top of `src/core`, not by duplicating note logic.

### Spelling is the lingua franca (NOT MIDI)

This is the one thing that differs from fretwise, and getting it wrong breaks the whole app.
Fretwise uses the MIDI number everywhere because on a fretboard only pitch matters. On a
staff, **spelling** matters: F♯ and G♭ sound the same but sit on **different lines**, and
telling them apart is exactly what the student is learning.

So a note is a `Spelled` (`{ step: 0..6, alter: -1|0|1, octave }`), and its **vertical
position** on the staff is the **diatonic index** `octave * 7 + step` (C4 = 28, E4 = 30,
G2 = 18) — the accidental does not move a note vertically. See `src/core/pitch.ts`.

- The diatonic index is the analogue of fretwise's `Position`: it is what gets drawn.
  `Mark.slot` is a diatonic index.
- **MIDI is output only.** `midiOf(spelled)` exists to feed the audio player. Never route
  an answer check through MIDI — `sameNote`/`checkNoteName` compare spelling, so an
  enharmonic is always wrong.

### A clef is just the diatonic of its bottom line

`src/core/clef.ts` defines each clef by one number: the diatonic index of the note on the
**lowest staff line** (treble = E4, bass = G2, alto = F3, tenor = D3…). Every other piece of
geometry is arithmetic from there: a line is 2 diatonics, a line→space step is 1.

`yForDiatonic` takes `topLineY` and `spacing` as **parameters** rather than assuming
VexFlow's defaults, and `Staff.tsx` feeds it `stave.getYForLine(0)` and
`stave.getSpacingBetweenLines()`. That is why the crop can never drift from the drawing, and
why the geometry is unit tested with no DOM. **Don't hardcode the 10px line spacing** — read
it back from the `Stave`.

### Modules are derived, not enumerated

`src/core/module.ts` builds the module list as `tarefa × conjunto-de-claves` with a template
literal type (`readNote:piano`, `readInterval:cello`, plus the standalone `readKey`).
Adding a clef set in `clefSet.ts` creates both note modules automatically and makes
TypeScript demand the new entries wherever a `Record<Module, …>` is used. The menu
(`Sidebar.tsx`) and the URLs (`lib/routes.ts`) are derived the same way, so **there is no list of 13 things to keep in sync.**

`single` vs `grand` layout is a real musical distinction, not a rendering detail:
- `grand` (piano) draws **both** staves at once and the note lands on one of them.
- `single` (cello, viola, the C clef) draws **one** staff and **re-draws the clef per
  question** — that is how those instruments actually read, switching clef mid-piece.

### How each task validates

- **readNote** — octave-agnostic: the spelling (letter + accidental) must match, in any
  octave. The student picks from all 7 letters — recall, not multiple choice, so there is no
  `choices` field. Whether the **accidental is asked** depends on `accidentalMode` (below):
  with a key signature it is the point of the question, so the ♭/♮/♯ selector is shown and
  the letters follow it; without one the accidental is drawn next to the note, so asking for
  it would only test copying and the letters carry it instead (`C♯ D♯ E♯…`).
- **readInterval** — two notes on one staff (in `grand`, the drawn staff), melodic or
  harmonic (`question.harmonic` → `Staff`'s `chord` prop). The interval comes from
  **spelling** (`src/core/interval.ts`): the number is the diatonic distance, the quality is
  what the accidentals do to it, so F–B (A4) and F–C♭ (d5) are different answers. `intervalAsk`
  `number` checks only the number; `quality` checks both, against the 13 `INTERVAL_CHOICES`
  (exactly the intervals of a major scale). The generator guarantees the answer is always one
  of them: inside a key signature it is by construction, and in `note` mode it only draws alter
  pairs that land in the list — so no A2/d4/doubly-augmented question with no button for it.
  Same `alter: 0` drawing rule as readNote in `key` mode.
- **readKey** — a key signature is **ambiguous** between the relative major and minor, so
  `question.keyAsk` always says which mode is being asked and every choice is that mode.
  Never "fix" this by accepting either answer.

### `accidentalMode`: where the accidental comes from

`none` (only naturals) · `note` (drawn beside the notehead) · `key` (**the default**: a key
signature at the clef, and the note is drawn *clean*).

In `key` mode the note's `alter` is not random — it is `alterInKey(step, keySig)`, exactly
what the signature imposes. So the mark is drawn with **`alter: 0`**: repeating the
accidental next to the notehead is both wrong notation and the answer handed over.

## State is split in two

- **`useSettings`** (`src/store/settings.ts`, zustand + `persist`, key `sheetwise-settings`,
  currently **version 4**): what the user chose. Adding a top-level field is safe. Adding a
  `ModuleConfig` field is safe too — `useModuleConfig` backfills missing fields from
  `DEFAULT_MODULE_CONFIG` on **read**, so persisted states never need a migration for a new
  option. Renaming or removing a field **does** need a `version` bump plus a `migrate`.
  So does *changing a default*: the backfill only fills what is **absent**, so a value
  already written keeps winning (v2 exists for exactly that — it turned accidentals on
  everywhere; v3 replaced the `accidentals` boolean with `accidentalMode`; v4 dropped the
  removed "mark notes" task — its `markNote:*` modules and the `slotHints` field). Only migrate a
  default when the intent is to override past choices.
- **`useExercise`** (`src/hooks/useExercise.ts`): the current question and answer. Per
  session, reset on every `next()` and on every module or config change. That reset happens
  **during render** (React's "adjust state when a prop changes"), never in an effect: an
  effect would leave one frame holding the previous module's question, and each task body
  reads fields only its own question has — `ReadKeyBody` hitting a note question's missing
  `keyChoices` blanked the screen until a reload.

Config objects passed to `useExercise` must be memoized in `App.tsx` (`useMemo`) — the hook
regenerates the question whenever a config **reference** changes.

Language lives outside the store, in `localStorage['sheetwise-lang']`. So does the last
opened module, `localStorage['sheetwise-module']` (`useRoute`): a module URL always wins, but
a path with no module — `/`, which is how the Android app always starts, or a stale link —
reopens the last one. `parseModule` drops a stored id that no longer exists.

## Note names are a setting, not a language

`naming: 'letters' | 'solfege'` decides between `C D E` and `Dó Ré Mi`. It is independent of
the UI language, and the labels come from `noteLabel`/`stepLabel` in `src/core/pitch.ts` —
**never from i18n**. i18n covers only UI chrome.

## UI placement rules

Modules are chosen in the Sidebar; **all configuration lives in the Settings modal**, with
sections gated by predicates (`isNoteModule`, `isReadInterval`, `usesCClef`,
`module === 'readKey'`).
Don't add settings to the exercise panel.

## Styling

Tailwind v4 through the Vite plugin — there is no `tailwind.config.*`. Design tokens
(colors, radius) are `@theme` custom properties in `src/index.css`, exposed as utilities
like `text-ink`, `bg-accent-soft`, `border-line`. There is only a light theme.

## The Staff component

`src/components/Staff/Staff.tsx` draws with VexFlow and then does two things by hand:

1. **Centers the notes.** The formatter left-aligns, which would glue the note to the clef.
   The shift is computed from the notes' bounding box (position **plus width**) and clamped
   to the note area, so the two notes of a melodic interval never spill past the barline.
   The shift is applied to the **`TickContext`**, never with `setXShift`: a note's `x_shift` belongs to
   VexFlow, which uses it to open room for the accidental, and overwriting it moved only the
   notehead — the accidental reads the absolute X (from the tick context) and stayed parked
   next to the clef.
2. **Crops the canvas.** VexFlow is given a generous canvas, then the `viewBox` is narrowed
   to the vertical extent the module actually uses. That extent comes from the configured
   **range**, not from the drawn note, so the staff does not jump between questions.
   VexFlow writes the original height into an inline `style`, which beats the `height`
   attribute — `svgEl.style.height` must be set too or the content ends up letterboxed.
   The margin around that extent is measured in **staff spaces**, not pixels: a ♭ reaches
   about a space and a half above the notehead, so a fixed margin clipped the accidental of
   the highest note in the range.

## Android (Capacitor)

`npm run android:apk` needs **JDK 21** — the Gradle wrapper is 8.14 and does not accept the
JDK 26 that is the system default here, so run it as
`JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk npm run android:apk`. The APK lands in
`android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`.

The web app is the whole app: Capacitor only wraps `dist/`, so `cap sync` copies the same
build the browser gets. The single native touch is `src/native/statusBar.ts`, a no-op off
device: the status bar is hidden in short landscape (the compact layout, so the staff owns
the screen) and shown in portrait. Android 15+ draws edge-to-edge regardless, so `TopBar`
and the sidebar drawer also pad themselves with `--safe-area-inset-*` (the variable comes
from Capacitor, `env()` is the web fallback, both 0 in the browser).

Launcher icons are generated, never hand-edited: `./scripts/gen-icons.sh` renders every
mipmap from `src/assets/brand/icon.svg` (the tile, same art as the favicon) and
`icon-fg.svg` (art only, in the 108-grid with the 66 safe zone the launcher crops to).

## Verifying UI changes

There are no component/E2E tests — only `src/core/*.test.ts` and `src/lib/routes.test.ts`
(Vitest). To verify UI behavior, drive the dev server with a headless browser:
`playwright-core` (devDep) launching the system Chromium at `/usr/bin/chromium`, navigate to
`localhost:5173`, interact, screenshot. Stable selector: `.staff` (the `<svg>` inside it
is the drawn staff).

## Not yet built

Web branding beyond the minimal `favicon.svg` (raster favicons, PWA icons — the Android
launcher icons *are* generated, see above), a signed release build, progress statistics, and
the reverse key-signature module (given a key, build the signature). The original
implementation plan is at `~/.claude/plans/sleepy-roaming-starfish.md`.
